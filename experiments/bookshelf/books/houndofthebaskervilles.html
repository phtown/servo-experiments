    <h2>
      Chapter 1. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon
      those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the
      breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which
      our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick
      piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a "Penang
      lawyer." Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
      across. "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.," was
      engraved upon it, with the date "1884." It was just such a stick as the
      old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry—dignified, solid,
      and reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of
      your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
      me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's
      stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion
      of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear
      you reconstruct the man by an examination of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
      companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
      well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
      appreciation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said Holmes. "Excellent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
      practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
      knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
      The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
      great amount of walking with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly sound!" said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess that
      to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly
      given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
      presentation in return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his chair
      and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that in all the accounts
      which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you
      have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not
      yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without
      possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my
      dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me
      keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my
      admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his
      methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system
      as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick
      from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then
      with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying
      the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interesting, though elementary," said he as he returned to his favourite
      corner of the settee. "There are certainly one or two indications upon the
      stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has anything escaped me?" I asked with some self-importance. "I trust
      that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
      in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not
      that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a
      country practitioner. And he walks a good deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I was right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To that extent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that was all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would suggest,
      for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a
      hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed
      before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest
      themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working
      hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of
      this unknown visitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross
      Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in
      town before going to the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in
      this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a
      presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a
      pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer
      withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for
      himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been
      a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,
      stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
      occasion of the change?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly seems probable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the
      hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could
      hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
      What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he
      could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician—little
      more than a senior student. And he left five years ago—the date is
      on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
      thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
      amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog,
      which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller
      than a mastiff."
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and
      blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you," said I, "but at
      least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man's
      age and professional career." From my small medical shelf I took down the
      Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers,
      but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">        "Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.
        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,
        with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?'  Corresponding
        member of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of
        'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882).  'Do We Progress?'
        (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer
        for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow."
</pre>
    <p>
      "No mention of that local hunt, Watson," said Holmes with a mischievous
      smile, "but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that
      I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I
      remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my
      experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives
      testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the
      country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a
      heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of
      his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog's jaw, as shown in the space
      between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not
      broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been—yes, by Jove, it is a
      curly-haired spaniel."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess
      of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I
      glanced up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very
      door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you,
      Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of
      assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you
      hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know
      not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of
      science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a
      typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long
      nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set
      closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed
      glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for
      his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long
      back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon
      the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of
      joy. "I am so very glad," said he. "I was not sure whether I had left it
      here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A presentation, I see," said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Charing Cross Hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear, that's bad!" said Holmes, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. "Why was it
      bad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a
      consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all," said Holmes. "And now,
      Dr. James Mortimer—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a man of precise mind, evidently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of
      the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I
      am addressing and not—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, this is my friend Dr. Watson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection
      with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had
      hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
      supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my
      finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the
      original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum.
      It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your
      skull."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. "You are an
      enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,"
      said he. "I observe from your forefinger that you make your own
      cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
      with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
      restless as the antennae of an insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
      which he took in our curious companion. "I presume, sir," said he at last,
      "that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you
      have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that
      as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself
      an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most
      serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the
      second highest expert in Europe—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?" asked
      Holmes with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
      must always appeal strongly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then had you not better consult him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of
      affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have
      not inadvertently—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a little," said Holmes. "I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely
      if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature
      of the problem is in which you demand my assistance."

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
