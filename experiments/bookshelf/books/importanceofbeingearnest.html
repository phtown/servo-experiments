<h2>FIRST ACT</h2>
<h3>SCENE</h3>
<p>Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon
Street.&nbsp; The room is luxuriously and artistically
furnished.&nbsp; The sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining
room.</p>
<p>[<b>Lane</b> is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and
after the music has ceased, <b>Algernon</b> enters.]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Did you hear what I was playing,
Lane?</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; I didn’t think it polite to listen,
sir.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; I’m sorry for that, for your
sake.&nbsp; I don’t play accurately—any one can play
accurately—but I play with wonderful expression.&nbsp; As
far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.&nbsp; I
keep science for Life.</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; And, speaking of the science of Life,
have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp; [Hands them on a
salver.]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; [Inspects them, takes two, and sits
down on the sofa.]&nbsp; Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from
your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr.
Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are
entered as having been consumed.</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Why is it that at a bachelor’s
establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?&nbsp;
I ask merely for information.</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; I attribute it to the superior quality of
the wine, sir.&nbsp; I have often observed that in married
households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Good heavens!&nbsp; Is marriage so
demoralising as that?</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; I believe it <i>is</i> a very pleasant
state, sir.&nbsp; I have had very little experience of it myself
up to the present.&nbsp; I have only been married once.&nbsp;
That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
a young person.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; [Languidly<i>.</i>]&nbsp; I don’t
know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; No, sir; it is not a very interesting
subject.&nbsp; I never think of it myself.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Very natural, I am sure.&nbsp; That
will do, Lane, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; Thank you, sir.&nbsp; [<b>Lane</b> goes
out.]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Lane’s views on marriage seem
somewhat lax.&nbsp; Really, if the lower orders don’t set
us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?&nbsp; They
seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral
responsibility.</p>
<p>[Enter <b>Lane</b>.]</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; Mr. Ernest Worthing.</p>
<p>[Enter <b>Jack</b>.]</p>
<p>[<b>Lane</b> goes out<i>.</i>]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; How are you, my dear Ernest?&nbsp; What
brings you up to town?</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Oh, pleasure, pleasure!&nbsp; What else
should bring one anywhere?&nbsp; Eating as usual, I see,
Algy!</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; [Stiffly<i>.</i>]&nbsp; I believe it is
customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five
o’clock.&nbsp; Where have you been since last Thursday?</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; [Sitting down on the sofa.]&nbsp; In the
country.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; What on earth do you do there?</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; [Pulling off his gloves<i>.</i>]&nbsp; When
one is in town one amuses oneself.&nbsp; When one is in the
country one amuses other people.&nbsp; It is excessively
boring.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; And who are the people you amuse?</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; [Airily<i>.</i>]&nbsp; Oh, neighbours,
neighbours.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Got nice neighbours in your part of
Shropshire?</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Perfectly horrid!&nbsp; Never speak to one
of them.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; How immensely you must amuse
them!&nbsp; [Goes over and takes sandwich.]&nbsp; By the way,
Shropshire is your county, is it not?</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; Shropshire?&nbsp; Yes, of
course.&nbsp; Hallo!&nbsp; Why all these cups?&nbsp; Why cucumber
sandwiches?&nbsp; Why such reckless extravagance in one so
young?&nbsp; Who is coming to tea?</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and
Gwendolen.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; How perfectly delightful!</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Yes, that is all very well; but I am
afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite approve of your being
here.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; May I ask why?</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; My dear fellow, the way you flirt with
Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.&nbsp; It is almost as bad as
the way Gwendolen flirts with you.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; I am in love with Gwendolen.&nbsp; I have
come up to town expressly to propose to her.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; I thought you had come up for pleasure?
. . . I call that business.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; How utterly unromantic you are!</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; I really don’t see anything
romantic in proposing.&nbsp; It is very romantic to be in
love.&nbsp; But there is nothing romantic about a definite
proposal.&nbsp; Why, one may be accepted.&nbsp; One usually is, I
believe.&nbsp; Then the excitement is all over.&nbsp; The very
essence of romance is uncertainty.&nbsp; If ever I get married,
I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; I have no doubt about that, dear
Algy.&nbsp; The Divorce Court was specially invented for people
whose memories are so curiously constituted.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Oh! there is no use speculating on that
subject.&nbsp; Divorces are made in Heaven—[<b>Jack</b>
puts out his hand to take a sandwich.&nbsp; <b>Algernon</b> at
once interferes.]&nbsp; Please don’t touch the cucumber
sandwiches.&nbsp; They are ordered specially for Aunt
Augusta.&nbsp; [Takes one and eats it.]</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Well, you have been eating them all the
time.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; That is quite a different matter.&nbsp;
She is my aunt.&nbsp; [Takes plate from below.]&nbsp; Have some
bread and butter.&nbsp; The bread and butter is for
Gwendolen.&nbsp; Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; [Advancing to table and helping
himself.]&nbsp; And very good bread and butter it is too.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat
as if you were going to eat it all.&nbsp; You behave as if you
were married to her already.&nbsp; You are not married to her
already, and I don’t think you ever will be.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Why on earth do you say that?</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Well, in the first place girls never
marry the men they flirt with.&nbsp; Girls don’t think it
right.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Oh, that is nonsense!</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; It isn’t.&nbsp; It is a great
truth.&nbsp; It accounts for the extraordinary number of
bachelors that one sees all over the place.&nbsp; In the second
place, I don’t give my consent.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Your consent!</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first
cousin.&nbsp; And before I allow you to marry her, you will have
to clear up the whole question of Cecily.&nbsp; [Rings bell.]</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Cecily!&nbsp; What on earth do you
mean?&nbsp; What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!&nbsp; I
don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.</p>
<p>[Enter <b>Lane</b>.]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Bring me that cigarette case Mr.
Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined
here.</p>
<p><b>Lane.</b>&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp; [<b>Lane</b> goes out.]</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Do you mean to say you have had my
cigarette case all this time?&nbsp; I wish to goodness you had
let me know.&nbsp; I have been writing frantic letters to
Scotland Yard about it.&nbsp; I was very nearly offering a large
reward.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Well, I wish you would offer one.&nbsp;
I happen to be more than usually hard up.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; There is no good offering a large reward
now that the thing is found.</p>
<p>[Enter <b>Lane</b> with the cigarette case on a salver.&nbsp;
<b>Algernon</b> takes it at once.&nbsp; <b>Lane</b> goes
out.]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; I think that is rather mean of you,
Ernest, I must say.&nbsp; [Opens case and examines it.]&nbsp;
However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the
inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after
all.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Of course it’s mine.&nbsp; [Moving to
him.]&nbsp; You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you
have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.&nbsp; It
is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette
case.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and
fast rule about what one should read and what one
shouldn’t.&nbsp; More than half of modern culture depends
on what one shouldn’t read.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; I am quite aware of the fact, and I
don’t propose to discuss modern culture.&nbsp; It
isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in
private.&nbsp; I simply want my cigarette case back.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Yes; but this isn’t your
cigarette case.&nbsp; This cigarette case is a present from some
one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know any
one of that name.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens
to be my aunt.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Your aunt!</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Charming old lady she is,
too.&nbsp; Lives at Tunbridge Wells.&nbsp; Just give it back to
me, Algy.</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; [Retreating to back of sofa.]&nbsp; But
why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and
lives at Tunbridge Wells?&nbsp; [Reading.]&nbsp; ‘From
little Cecily with her fondest love.’</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon
it.]&nbsp; My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?&nbsp;
Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.&nbsp; That is a
matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for
herself.&nbsp; You seem to think that every aunt should be
exactly like your aunt!&nbsp; That is absurd!&nbsp; For
Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case.&nbsp;
[Follows <b>Algernon</b> round the room.]</p>
<p><b>Algernon.</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But why does your aunt call
you her uncle?&nbsp; ‘From little Cecily, with her fondest
love to her dear Uncle Jack.’&nbsp; There is no objection,
I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no
matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her
uncle, I can’t quite make out.&nbsp; Besides, your name
isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.</p>
<p><b>Jack.</b>&nbsp; It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.</p>

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
