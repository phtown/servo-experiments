<h5 id="id00014">  BOOK I.</h5>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with no middle flight intends to soar<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the highth of this great Argument<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I may assert th' Eternal Providence,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And justifie the wayes of God to men.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00016">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From their Creator, and transgress his Will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who first seduc'd them to that fowl revolt?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To set himself in Glory above his Peers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He trusted to have equal'd the most High,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Throne and Monarchy of God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With hideous ruine and combustion down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To mortal men, he with his horrid crew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Confounded though immortal: But his doom<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That witness'd huge affliction and dismay<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At once as far as Angels kenn he views<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The dismal Situation waste and wilde,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;No light, but rather darkness visible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes to all; but torture without end<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In utter darkness, and their portion set<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;O how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BEELZEBUB.  To whom th' Arch-Enemy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the horrid silence thus began.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00017">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From him, who in the happy Realms of Light<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He with his Thunder: and till then who knew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can else inflict do I repent or change,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the fierce contention brought along<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And courage never to submit or yield:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is else not to be overcome?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That Glory never shall his wrath or might<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With suppliant knee, and deifie his power<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the terrour of this Arm so late<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since through experience of this great event<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;We may with more successful hope resolve<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To wage by force or guile eternal Warr<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00018">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00019">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And put to proof his high Supremacy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Too well I see and rue the dire event,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with sad overthrow and foul defeat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here swallow'd up in endless misery.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Have left us this our spirit and strength intire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By right of Warr, what e're his business be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What can it then avail though yet we feel<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength undiminisht, or eternal being<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To undergo eternal punishment?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00020">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To do ought good never will be our task,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As being the contrary to his high will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom we resist.  If then his Providence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of good still to find means of evil;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His inmost counsels from their destind aim.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But see the angry Victor hath recall'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The seat of desolation, voyd of light,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;How overcome this dire Calamity,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If not what resolution from despare.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00021">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with reiterated crimes he might<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil to others, and enrag'd might see<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On Man by him seduc't, but on himself<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And such appear'd in hue, as when the force<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave a singed bottom all involv'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00022">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is its own place, and in it self<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter where, if I be still the same,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I should be, all but less then hee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' associates and copartners of our loss<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And call them not to share with us their part<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00023">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus answer'd.  Leader of those Armies bright,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;New courage and revive, though now they lye<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00024">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Under amazement of their hideous change.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If such astonishment as this can sieze<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;After the toyl of Battel to repose<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' advantage, and descending tread us down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00025">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A multitude, like which the populous North<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;God their Creator, and th' invisible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And Devils to adore for Deities:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then were they known to men by various Names,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Abominations; and with cursed things<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To his grim Idol.  Him the AMMONITE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of utmost ARNON.  Nor content with such<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Temple right against the Temple of God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From AROER to NEBO, and the wild<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can execute their aerie purposes,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of despicable foes.  With these in troop<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In SION also not unsung, where stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To Idols foul.  THAMMUZ came next behind,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of alienated JUDAH.  Next came one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He also against the house of God was bold:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he had vanquisht.  After these appear'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather then human.  Nor did ISRAEL scape<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With lust and violence the house of God.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And injury and outrage: And when Night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the prime in order and in might;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the universal Host upsent<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To highth of noblest temper Hero's old<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing united force with fixed thought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glories: For never since created man,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Could merit more then that small infantry<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By FONTARABBIA.  Thus far these beyond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All her Original brightness, nor appear'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark'n'd so, yet shon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With singed top their stately growth though bare<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

<h4 id="id00437" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id00438">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id00439">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h4 id="id00444" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h4>

<p id="id00445">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id00446">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id00447">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id00448">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id00449">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<h4 id="id00450" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p id="id00451">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id00452" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00453" style="margin-top: 2em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p id="id00454">     http://www.gutenberg.net<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00455">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
