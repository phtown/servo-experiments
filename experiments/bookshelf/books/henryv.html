<p id="id00072"><h1>The Life of Henry the Fifth</h1></p>

<p id="id00073">Enter Prologue.</p>

<p id="id00074">O For a Muse of Fire, that would ascend<br>

The brightest Heauen of Inuention:<br>

A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act,<br>

And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene.<br>

Then should the Warlike Harry, like himselfe,<br>

Assume the Port of Mars, and at his heeles<br>

(Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire<br>

Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:<br>

The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd,<br>

On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth<br>

So great an Obiect. Can this Cock-Pit hold<br>

The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme<br>

Within this Woodden O, the very Caskes<br>

That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?<br>

O pardon: since a crooked Figure may<br>

Attest in little place a Million,<br>

And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt,<br>

On your imaginarie Forces worke.<br>

Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls<br>

Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies,<br>

Whose high, vp-reared, and abutting Fronts,<br>

The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder.<br>

Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:<br>

Into a thousand parts diuide one Man,<br>

And make imaginarie Puissance.<br>

Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them<br>

Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:<br>

For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings,<br>

Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;<br>

Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres<br>

Into an Howre-glasse: for the which supplie,<br>

Admit me Chorus to this Historie;<br>

Who Prologue-like, your humble patience pray,<br>

Gently to heare, kindly to iudge our Play.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00075" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.</p>

<p id="id00076">Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.</p>

<p id="id00077">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd,<br>

Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign<br>

Was like, and had indeed against vs past,<br>

But that the scambling and vnquiet time<br>

Did push it out of farther question<br>
</p>

<p id="id00078">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,<br>

We loose the better halfe of our Possession:<br>

For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout<br>

By Testament haue giuen to the Church,<br>

Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,<br>

As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,<br>

Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,<br>

Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:<br>

And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age<br>

Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,<br>

A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd:<br>

And to the Coffers of the King beside,<br>

A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill<br>
</p>

<p id="id00079">   Bish.Ely. This would drinke deepe</p>

<p id="id00080">   Bish.Cant. 'Twould drinke the Cup and all</p>

<p id="id00081">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Ely. But what preuention?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard<br>
</p>

<p id="id00082">   Bish.Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church</p>

<p id="id00083">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not.<br>

The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,<br>

But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,<br>

Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,<br>

Consideration like an Angell came,<br>

And whipt th' offending Adam out of him;<br>

Leauing his body as a Paradise,<br>

T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.<br>

Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:<br>

Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,<br>

With such a heady currance scowring faults:<br>

Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse<br>

So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;<br>

As in this King<br>
</p>

<p id="id00084">   Bish.Ely. We are blessed in the Change</p>

<p id="id00085">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;<br>

And all-admiring, with an inward wish<br>

You would desire the King were made a Prelate:<br>

Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;<br>

You would say, it hath been all in all his study:<br>

List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare<br>

A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.<br>

Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,<br>

The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,<br>

Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,<br>

The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,<br>

And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,<br>

To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:<br>

So that the Art and Practique part of Life,<br>

Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.<br>

Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,<br>

Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,<br>

His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,<br>

His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;<br>

And neuer noted in him any studie,<br>

Any retyrement, any sequestration,<br>

From open Haunts and Popularitie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00086">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,<br>

And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,<br>

Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:<br>

And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation<br>

Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)<br>

Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,<br>

Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00087">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. It must be so; for Miracles are ceast:<br>

And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,<br>

How things are perfected<br>
</p>

<p id="id00088">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. But my good Lord:<br>

How now for mittigation of this Bill,<br>

Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie<br>

Incline to it, or no?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. He seemes indifferent:<br>

Or rather swaying more vpon our part,<br>

Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:<br>

For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,<br>

Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,<br>

And in regard of Causes now in hand,<br>

Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,<br>

As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,<br>

Then euer at one time the Clergie yet<br>

Did to his Predecessors part withall<br>
</p>

<p id="id00089">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie:<br>

Saue that there was not time enough to heare,<br>

As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,<br>

The seueralls and vnhidden passages<br>

Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,<br>

And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,<br>

Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather<br>
</p>

<p id="id00090">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant<br>

Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,<br>

To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Ely. It is<br>
</p>

<p id="id00091">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:<br>

Which I could with a ready guesse declare,<br>

Before the Frenchman speake a word of it<br>
</p>

<p id="id00092">   B.Ely. Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.</p>

<p id="id00093">Exeunt.</p>

<p id="id00094">Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick,<br>

Westmerland, and<br>

Exeter.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00095">&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Exeter. Not here in presence<br>
</p>

<p id="id00096">   King. Send for him, good Vnckle</p>

<p id="id00097">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westm. Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd,<br>

Before we heare him, of some things of weight,<br>

That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.<br>

Enter two Bishops.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00098">&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Cant. God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne,<br>

And make you long become it<br>
</p>

<p id="id00099">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Sure we thanke you.<br>

My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,<br>

And iustly and religiously vnfold,<br>

Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,<br>

Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:<br>

And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,<br>

That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,<br>

Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,<br>

With opening Titles miscreate, whose right<br>

Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:<br>

For God doth know, how many now in health,<br>

Shall drop their blood, in approbation<br>

Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.<br>

Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,<br>

How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;<br>

We charge you in the Name of God take heed:<br>

For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,<br>

Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops<br>

Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,<br>

'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,<br>

That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.<br>

Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:<br>

For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,<br>

That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,<br>

As pure as sinne with Baptisme<br>
</p>

<p id="id00100">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, &amp; you Peers,<br>

That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,<br>

To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre<br>

To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,<br>

But this which they produce from Pharamond,<br>

In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,<br>

No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:<br>

Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze<br>

To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond<br>

The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.<br>

Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,<br>

That the Land Salike is in Germanie,<br>

Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:<br>

Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,<br>

There left behind and settled certaine French:<br>

Who holding in disdaine the German Women,<br>

For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>

Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female<br>

Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:<br>

Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,<br>

Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen.<br>

Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law<br>

Was not deuised for the Realme of France:<br>

Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land,<br>

Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres<br>

After defunction of King Pharamond,<br>

Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,<br>

Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,<br>

Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great<br>

Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>

Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere<br>

Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,<br>

King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,<br>

Did as Heire Generall, being descended<br>

Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,<br>

Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.<br>

Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne<br>

Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male<br>

Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:<br>

To find his Title with some shewes of truth,<br>

Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,<br>

Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare,<br>

Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne<br>

To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne<br>

Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,<br>

Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,<br>

Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,<br>

Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,<br>

That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,<br>

Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,<br>

Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:<br>

By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great<br>

Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.<br>

So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,<br>

King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,<br>

King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare<br>

To hold in Right and Title of the Female:<br>

So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.<br>

Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,<br>

To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,<br>

And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,<br>

Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,<br>

Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors<br>
</p>

<p id="id00101">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. May I with right and conscience make this claim?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Cant. The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:<br>

For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ,<br>

When the man dyes, let the Inheritance<br>

Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,<br>

Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,<br>

Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:<br>

Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,<br>

From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,<br>

And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince,<br>

Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie,<br>

Making defeat on the full Power of France:<br>

Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill<br>

Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe<br>

Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.<br>

O Noble English, that could entertaine<br>

With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,<br>

And let another halfe stand laughing by,<br>

All out of worke, and cold for action<br>
</p>

<p id="id00102">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,<br>

And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;<br>

You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:<br>

The Blood and Courage that renowned them,<br>

Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege<br>

Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,<br>

Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises<br>
</p>

<p id="id00103">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth<br>

Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,<br>

As did the former Lyons of your Blood<br>
</p>

<p id="id00104">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West. They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;<br>

So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England<br>

Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,<br>

Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,<br>

And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France<br>
</p>

<p id="id00105">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege<br>

With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:<br>

In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie<br>

Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,<br>

As neuer did the Clergie at one time<br>

Bring in to any of your Ancestors<br>
</p>

<p id="id00106">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,<br>

But lay downe our proportions, to defend<br>

Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,<br>

With all aduantages<br>
</p>

<p id="id00107">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Can. They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,<br>

Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend<br>

Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers<br>
</p>

<p id="id00108">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,<br>

But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,<br>

Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:<br>

For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather<br>

Neuer went with his forces into France,<br>

But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,<br>

Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,<br>

With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,<br>

Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,<br>

Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:<br>

That England being emptie of defence,<br>

Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood<br>
</p>

<p id="id00109">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:<br>

For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,<br>

When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,<br>

And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,<br>

Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,<br>

But taken and impounded as a Stray,<br>

The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,<br>

To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,<br>

And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,<br>

As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea<br>

With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries<br>
</p>

<p id="id00110">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bish.Ely. But there's a saying very old and true,<br>

If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.<br>

For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,<br>

To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)<br>

Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,<br>

Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,<br>

To tame and hauocke more then she can eate<br>
</p>

<p id="id00111">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,<br>

Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,<br>

Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,<br>

And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.<br>

While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,<br>

Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:<br>

For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,<br>

Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,<br>

Congreeing in a full and natural close,<br>

Like Musicke<br>
</p>

<p id="id00112">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide<br>

The state of man in diuers functions,<br>

Setting endeuour in continual motion:<br>

To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,<br>

Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,<br>

Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach<br>

The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.<br>

They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,<br>

Where some like Magistrates correct at home:<br>

Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:<br>

Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,<br>

Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:<br>

Which pillage, they with merry march bring home<br>

To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:<br>

Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes<br>

The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,<br>

The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;<br>

The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in<br>

Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:<br>

The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,<br>

Deliuering ore to Executors pale<br>

The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,<br>

That many things hauing full reference<br>

To one consent, may worke contrariously,<br>

As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes<br>

Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,<br>

As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;<br>

As many Lynes close in the Dials center:<br>

So may a thousand actions once a foote,<br>

And in one purpose, and be all well borne<br>

Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,<br>

Diuide your happy England into foure,<br>

Whereof, take you one quarter into France,<br>

And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.<br>

If we with thrice such powers left at home,<br>

Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,<br>

Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose<br>

The name of hardinesse and policie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00113">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.<br>

Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe<br>

And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,<br>

France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,<br>

Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,<br>

(Ruling in large and ample Emperie,<br>

Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)<br>

Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,<br>

Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:<br>

Either our History shall with full mouth<br>

Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue<br>

Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,<br>

Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.<br>

Enter Ambassadors of France.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00114">Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure<br>

Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,<br>

Your greeting is from him, not from the King<br>
</p>

<p id="id00115">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amb. May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue<br>

Freely to render what we haue in charge:<br>

Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off<br>

The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00116">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,<br>

Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect<br>

As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,<br>

Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,<br>

Tell vs the Dolphins minde<br>
</p>

<p id="id00117">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amb. Thus than in few:<br>

Your Highnesse lately sending into France,<br>

Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right<br>

Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third.<br>

In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master<br>

Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,<br>

And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,<br>

That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:<br>

You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.<br>

He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit<br>

This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,<br>

Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime<br>

Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes<br>
</p>

<p id="id00118">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. What Treasure Vncle?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Tennis balles, my Liege<br>
</p>

<p id="id00119">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kin. We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,<br>

His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:<br>

When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,<br>

We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,<br>

Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.<br>

Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,<br>

That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd<br>

With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,<br>

How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,<br>

Not measuring what vse we made of them.<br>

We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,<br>

And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe<br>

To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,<br>

That men are merriest, when they are from home.<br>

But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,<br>

Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,<br>

When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.<br>

For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,<br>

And plodded like a man for working dayes:<br>

But I will rise there with so full a glorie,<br>

That I will dazle all the eyes of France,<br>

Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,<br>

And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his<br>

Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule<br>

Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance<br>

That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows<br>

Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;<br>

Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:<br>

And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,<br>

That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.<br>

But this lyes all within the wil of God,<br>

To whom I do appeale, and in whose name<br>

Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,<br>

To venge me as I may, and to put forth<br>

My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause.<br>

So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,<br>

His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,<br>

When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.<br>

Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.<br>

Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:<br>

If little faults proceeding on distemper,<br>

Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye<br>

When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,<br>

Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,<br>

Though Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care<br>

Gray of Northumberland, this same is yours:<br>

Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.<br>

My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,<br>

We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?<br>

What see you in those papers, that you loose<br>

So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:<br>

Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,<br>

That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood<br>

Out of apparance<br>

By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd:<br>

You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,<br>

For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,<br>

As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:<br>

See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,<br>

These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,<br>

You know how apt our loue was, to accord<br>

To furnish with all appertinents<br>

Belonging to his Honour; and this man,<br>

Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd<br>

And sworne vnto the practises of France<br>

To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,<br>

This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs<br>

Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,<br>

What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,<br>

Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?<br>

Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,<br>

That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,<br>

That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,<br>

Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?<br>

May it be possible, that forraigne hyer<br>

Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill<br>

That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,<br>

That though the truth of it stands off as grosse<br>

As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.<br>

Treason, and murther, euer kept together,<br>

As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,<br>

Working so grossely in an naturall cause,<br>

That admiration did not hoope at them.<br>

But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in<br>

Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:<br>

And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was<br>

That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,<br>

Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:<br>

And other diuels that suggest by treasons,<br>

Do botch and bungle vp damnation,<br>

With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht<br>

From glist'ring semblances of piety:<br>

But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,<br>

Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,<br>

Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.<br>

If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,<br>

Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,<br>

He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,<br>

And tell the Legions, I can neuer win<br>

A soule so easie as that Englishmans.<br>

Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected<br>

The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,<br>

Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?<br>

Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?<br>

Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?<br>

Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,<br>

Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,<br>

Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,<br>

Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,<br>

Not working with the eye, without the eare,<br>

And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,<br>

Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:<br>

And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,<br>

To make thee full fraught man, and best indued<br>

With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.<br>

For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like<br>

Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,<br>

Arrest them to the answer of the Law,<br>

And God acquit them of their practises<br>
</p>

<p id="id00193">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of<br>

Richard Earle of Cambridge.<br>

I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas<br>

Lord Scroope of Marsham.<br>

I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas<br>

Grey, Knight of Northumberland<br>
</p>

<p id="id00194">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scro. Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd,<br>

And I repent my fault more then my death,<br>

Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,<br>

Although my body pay the price of it<br>
</p>

<p id="id00195">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam. For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,<br>

Although I did admit it as a motiue,<br>

The sooner to effect what I intended:<br>

But God be thanked for preuention,<br>

Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce,<br>

Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee<br>
</p>

<p id="id00196">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray. Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce<br>

At the discouery of most dangerous Treason,<br>

Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,<br>

Preuented from a damned enterprize;<br>

My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne<br>
</p>

<p id="id00197">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence<br>

You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person,<br>

Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers,<br>

Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death:<br>

Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,<br>

His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,<br>

His Subiects to oppression, and contempt,<br>

And his whole Kingdome into desolation:<br>

Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge,<br>

But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,<br>

Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes<br>

We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,<br>

(Poore miserable wretches) to your death:<br>

The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue<br>

You patience to indure, and true Repentance<br>

Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence.<br>

Enter.<br>

<p id="id00198">Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof<br>

Shall be to you as vs, like glorious.<br>

We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,<br>

Since God so graciously hath brought to light<br>

To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,<br>

But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.<br>

Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer<br>

Our Puissance into the hand of God,<br>

And more then carefully it vs concernes,<br>

To answer Royally in our defences.<br>

Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,<br>

Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,<br>

And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch<br>

To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre<br>

With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:<br>

For England his approaches makes as fierce,<br>

(Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)<br>

But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,<br>

Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,<br>

As were a Warre in expectation.<br>

Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth,<br>

To view the sick and feeble parts of France:<br>

And let vs doe it with no shew of feare,<br>

No, with no more, then if we heard that England<br>

Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance:<br>

For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd,<br>

Her Scepter so phantastically borne,<br>

By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth,<br>

That feare attends her not<br>

<p id="id00228">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Const. O peace, Prince Dolphin,<br>

You are too much mistaken in this King:<br>

Question your Grace the late Embassadors,<br>

With what great State he heard their Embassie,<br>

How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,<br>

How modest in exception; and withall,<br>

How terrible in constant resolution:<br>

And you shall find, his Vanities fore-spent,<br>

Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus,<br>

As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots<br>

That shall first spring, and be most delicate<br>

<p id="id00229">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolphin. Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.<br>

But though we thinke it so, it is no matter:<br>

In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh<br>

The Enemie more mightie then he seemes,<br>

So the proportions of defence are fill'd:<br>

Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,<br>

Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting<br>

A little Cloth<br>

Of that black Name, Edward, black Prince of Wales:<br>

Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing<br>

Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne,<br>

Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him<br>

Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface<br>

The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers<br>

That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart<br>

The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen,<br>

By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs<br>

To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne,<br>

And all wide-stretched Honors, that pertaine<br>

By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times,<br>

Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know<br>

'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme,<br>

Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes,<br>

Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt,<br>

He sends you this most memorable Lyne,<br>

In euery Branch truly demonstratiue;<br>

Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree:<br>

And when you find him euenly deriu'd<br>

From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors,<br>

Edward the third; he bids you then resigne<br>

Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held<br>

From him, the Natiue and true Challenger<br>
</p>

<p id="id00235">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Or else what followes?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne<br>

Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.<br>

Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,<br>

In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue:<br>

That if requiring faile, he will compell.<br>

And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,<br>

Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie<br>

On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre<br>

Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head<br>

Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,<br>

The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,<br>

For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,<br>

That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.<br>

This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message:<br>

Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here;<br>

To whom expressely I bring greeting to<br>

</p>

<p id="id00237">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolph. For the Dolphin,<br>

I stand here for him: what to him from England?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt,<br>

And any thing that may not mis-become<br>

The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.<br>

Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse<br>

Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large,<br>

Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;<br>

Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it,<br>

That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France<br>

Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock<br>

In second Accent of his Ordinance<br>
</p>

<p id="id00238">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolph. Say: if my Father render faire returne,<br>

It is against my will: for I desire<br>

Nothing but Oddes with England.<br>

To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie,<br>

I did present him with the Paris-Balls<br>
</p>

<p id="id00239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exe. Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it,<br>

Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe:<br>

And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence,<br>

As we his Subiects haue in wonder found,<br>

Betweene the promise of his greener dayes,<br>

And these he masters now: now he weighes Time<br>

for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,
hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole
Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece
of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues
or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.
I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed<br>

at the Bridge<br>
</p>

<p id="id00343">   Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
  Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient
Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
him doe as gallant seruice</p>

<p id="id00344">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gower. What doe you call him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll<br>

Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well<br>
</p>

<p id="id00348">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at<br>

his hands<br>
</p>

<p id="id00349">   Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone</p>

<p id="id00350">   Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is
painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description
of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall</p>

<p id="id00351">   Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter
hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
his Life, and I will thee requite</p>

<p id="id00352" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your
meaning</p>

<p id="id00353">   Pist. Why then reioyce therefore</p>

<p id="id00354">   Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;
for discipline ought to be vsed</p>

<p id="id00355">   Pist. Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship</p>

<p id="id00356">   Flu. It is well</p>

<p id="id00357">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pist. The Figge of Spaine.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00358">  Flu. Very good</p>

remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse</p>

<p id="id00360">   Flu. Ile assure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the
Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
when time is serue</p>

<p id="id00361">   Gower. Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:
who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd,
what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among
foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull
to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke</p>

<p id="id00362">   Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue
hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
must speake with him from the Pridge.</p>

<p id="id00363">Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.</p>

<p id="id00364">  Flu. God plesse your Maiestie</p>

<p id="id00365">   King. How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
  Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
the Duke is a praue man</p>

<p id="id00366">   King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?
  Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie
know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
out</p>

<p id="id00367">   King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages;
nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
Gamester is the soonest winner.</p>

<p id="id00368">Tucket. Enter Mountioy.</p>

<p id="id00369">  Mountioy. You know me by my habit</p>

<p id="id00370">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of<br>

thee?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountioy. My Masters mind<br>
</p>

<p id="id00371">   King. Vnfold it</p>

<p id="id00372">   Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:
England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,
and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider
of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse
satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
so much my Office</p>

<p id="id00373">   King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie</p>

<p id="id00374">   Mount. Mountioy</p>

And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,<br>

But could be willing to march on to Callice,<br>

Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,<br>

Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much<br>

Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,<br>

My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,<br>

My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,<br>

Almost no better then so many French;<br>

Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,<br>

I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges<br>

Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,<br>

That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France<br>

Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:<br>

Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;<br>

My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;<br>

My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:<br>

Yet God before, tell him we will come on,<br>

Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor<br>

Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy.<br>

Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.<br>

If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,<br>

We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood<br>

Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well.<br>

The summe of all our Answer is but this:<br>

We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,<br>

Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:<br>

So tell your Master<br>
</p>

<p id="id00376">   Mount. I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bates. I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham<br>
</p>

<p id="id00487">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams. A good old Commander, and a most kinde<br>

Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to<br>

be washt off the next Tyde<br>
</p>

<p id="id00488">   Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?
  King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I
speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:
the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element
shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but
humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse
he appeares but a man; and though his affections
are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,
they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army</p>

<p id="id00489">   Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:
but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe
in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here</p>

<p id="id00490">   King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
but where hee is</p>

<p id="id00491" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued</p>

<p id="id00492">   King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him
here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,
as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
his Quarrell honorable</p>

<p id="id00493">   Williams. That's more then we know</p>

<p id="id00494">   Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
the Cryme of it out of vs</p>

<p id="id00495">   Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe
hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed
at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;
some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion
of subiection</p>

<p id="id00496">   King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation
of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed
vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder
his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,
be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement
of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:
some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling
Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored
the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.
Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne
Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip
men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before
guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue
that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
how they should prepare</p>

<p id="id00497">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon<br>

his owne head, the King is not to answer it<br>
</p>

<p id="id00498">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and<br>

yet I determine to fight lustily for him<br>
</p>

<p id="id00499">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be<br>

ransom'd<br>
</p>

<p id="id00500">   Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
ne're the wiser</p>

<p id="id00501">   King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after</p>

<p id="id00502">   Will. You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
come, 'tis a foolish saying</p>

<p id="id00503">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should<br>

be angry with you, if the time were conuenient<br>
</p>

<p id="id00504">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you<br>

<p id="id00505">   King. I embrace it</p>

O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth.<br>

What? is thy Soule of Odoration?<br>

Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme,<br>

Creating awe and feare in other men?<br>

Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd,<br>

Then they in fearing.<br>

What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet,<br>

But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse,<br>

And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure.<br>

Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out<br>

With Titles blowne from Adulation?<br>

Will it giue place to flexure and low bending?<br>

Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee,<br>

Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame,<br>

That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose.<br>

I am a King that find thee: and I know,<br>

'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball,<br>

The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall,<br>

The enter-tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle,<br>

The farsed Title running 'fore the King,<br>

The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe,<br>

That beates vpon the high shore of this World:<br>

No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie;<br>

Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall,<br>

Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue:<br>

Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind,<br>

Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread,<br>

Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of Hell:<br>

But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set,<br>

Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night<br>

Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne,<br>

Doth rise and helpe Hiperio[n] to his Horse,<br>

And followes so the euer-running yeere<br>

With profitable labour to his Graue:<br>

And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch,<br>

Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe,<br>

Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King.<br>

The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace,<br>

Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots,<br>

Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord,<br>

O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault<br>

My Father made, in compassing the Crowne.<br>

I Richards body haue interred new,<br>

And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,<br>

Then from it issued forced drops of blood.<br>

Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay,<br>

Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp<br>

Toward Heauen, to pardon blood:<br>

And I haue built two Chauntries,<br>

Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still<br>

For Richards Soule. More will I doe:<br>

My Cousin Westmerland. No, my faire Cousin:<br>

If we are markt to dye, we are enow<br>

To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,<br>

The fewer men, the greater share of honour.<br>

Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more.<br>

By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold,<br>

Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:<br>

It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;<br>

Such outward things dwell not in my desires.<br>

But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,<br>

I am the most offending Soule aliue.<br>

No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England:<br>

Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor,<br>

As one man more me thinkes would share from me,<br>

For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more:<br>

Rather proclaime it (Westmerland) through my Hoast,<br>

That he which hath no stomack to this fight,<br>

Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made,<br>

And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse:<br>

We would not dye in that mans companie,<br>

That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs.<br>

This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian:<br>

He that out-liues this day, and comes safe home,<br>

Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,<br>

And rowse him at the Name of Crispian.<br>

He that shall see this day, and liue old age,<br>

Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours,<br>

And say, to morrow is Saint Crispian.<br>

Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres:<br>

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot:<br>

But hee'le remember, with aduantages,<br>

What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names,<br>

Familiar in his mouth as household words,<br>

Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,<br>

Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,<br>

Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred.<br>

This story shall the good man teach his sonne:<br>

And Crispine Crispian shall ne're goe by,<br>

From this day to the ending of the World,<br>

But we in it shall be remembred;<br>

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:<br>

For he to day that sheds his blood with me,<br>

Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile,<br>

This day shall gentle his Condition.<br>

And Gentlemen in England, now a bed,<br>

Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here;<br>

If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound,<br>

Before thy most assured Ouerthrow:<br>

For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe,<br>

Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy<br>

The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind<br>

Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules<br>

May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre<br>

From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies<br>

Must lye and fester<br>

<p id="id00558">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I pray thee beare my former Answer back:<br>

Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones.<br>

Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus?<br>

The man that once did sell the Lyons skin<br>

While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him.<br>

A many of our bodyes shall no doubt<br>

Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust<br>

Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke.<br>

And those that leaue their valiant bones in France,<br>

Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills,<br>

They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them,<br>

And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,<br>

Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,<br>

The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.<br>

Marke then abounding valour in our English:<br>

That being dead, like to the bullets crasing,<br>

Breake out into a second course of mischiefe,<br>

Killing in relapse of Mortalitie.<br>

Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable,<br>

We are but Warriors for the working day:<br>

Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht<br>

With raynie Marching in the painefull field.<br>

There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast:<br>

Good argument (I hope) we will not flye:<br>

And time hath worne vs into slouenrie.<br>

But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim:<br>

And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night,<br>

They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck<br>

The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,<br>

And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,<br>

As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then<br>

Will soone be leuyed.<br>

Herauld, saue thou thy labour:<br>

Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,<br>

They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts:<br>

Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them,<br>

Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable<br>

Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,<br>

A Testament of Noble-ending-loue:<br>

With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue to.<br>

<p id="id00607">Alarum</p>

<p id="id00608">But hearke, what new alarum is this same?<br>

The French haue re-enforc'd their scatter'd men:<br>

Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners,<br>

Giue the word through.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00609">Exit</p>

<p id="id00610" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Quartus.</p>

<p id="id00611">Enter Fluellen and Gower.</p>

<p id="id00612">  Flu. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery
marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
now, is it not?
  Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done
this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away
all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners
throat. O 'tis a gallant King</p>

<p id="id00613">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower:<br>

What call you the Townes name where Alexander the<br>

pig was borne?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gow. Alexander the Great<br>
</p>

<p id="id00614">   Flu. Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,
are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations</p>

<p id="id00615">   Gower. I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in
Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I
take it</p>

<p id="id00616">   Flu. I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is
porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene
Macedon &amp; Monmouth, that the situations looke
you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, &amp; there
is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at
Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is
come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his
rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
Clytus</p>

<p id="id00617" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
any of his friends</p>

<p id="id00618">   Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander
kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his
good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name</p>

<p id="id00619">   Gow. Sir Iohn Falstaffe</p>

<p id="id00620" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Flu. That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne
at Monmouth</p>

<p id="id00622">Alarum. Enter King Harry and Burbon with prisoners. Flourish.</p>

<p id="id00623">&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I was not angry since I came to France,<br>

Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald,<br>

Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:<br>

If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,<br>

Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight.<br>

If they'l do neither, we will come to them,<br>

And make them sker away, as swift as stones<br>

Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:<br>

Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue,<br>

And not a man of them that we shall take,<br>

Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.<br>

Enter Montioy.<br>

That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome?<br>

Com'st thou againe for ransome?<br>

I come to thee for charitable License,<br>

That we may wander ore this bloody field,<br>

To booke our dead, and then to bury them,<br>

To sort our Nobles from our common men.<br>

For many of our Princes (woe the while)<br>

Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:<br>

So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes<br>

In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds<br>

Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage<br>

Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,<br>

Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,<br>

To view the field in safety, and dispose<br>

Of their dead bodies<br>

<p id="id00629">   Her. They call it Agincourt</p>

<p id="id00707">   Gour. Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him</p>

<p id="id00708">   Flu. I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke,
or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is
good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxecombe</p>

<p id="id00709">   Pist. Must I bite</p>

<p id="id00710">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of question<br>

too, and ambiguities<br>
</p>

<p id="id00711">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pist. By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I<br>

eate and eate I sweare<br>
</p>

<p id="id00712">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce<br>

to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by<br>
</p>

<p id="id00713">   Pist. Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate</p>

<p id="id00714">   Flu. Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay,
pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your
broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see
Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all</p>

<p id="id00715">   Pist. Good</p>

<p id="id00716">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to<br>

heale your pate<br>
</p>

<p id="id00717">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pist. Me a groat?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Flu. Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue<br>

another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate<br>
</p>

<p id="id00718">   Pist. I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge</p>

<p id="id00719">   Flu. If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cudgels,
you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of
me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, &amp; heale
your pate.</p>

<p id="id00720">Exit</p>

<p id="id00721">  Pist. All hell shall stirre for this</p>

<p id="id00722">   Gow. Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue,
will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking &amp; galling
at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise,
and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach
you a good English condition, fare ye well.</p>

<p id="id00723">Exit</p>

The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes:<br>

The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope<br>

Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd<br>

With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,<br>

To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties<br>

Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;<br>

Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.<br>

Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,<br>

That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,<br>

You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,<br>

If I demand before this Royall view,<br>

What Rub, or what Impediment there is,<br>

Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,<br>

Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,<br>

Should not in this best Garden of the World,<br>

Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?<br>

Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,<br>

And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,<br>

Corrupting in it owne fertilitie.<br>

Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,<br>

Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,<br>

Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,<br>

Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,<br>

The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,<br>

Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,<br>

That should deracinate such Sauagery:<br>

The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth<br>

The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,<br>

Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;<br>

Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,<br>

But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,<br>

Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;<br>

And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,<br>

Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.<br>

Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,<br>

Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,<br>

The Sciences that should become our Countrey;<br>

But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,<br>

That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,<br>

To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,<br>

And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.<br>

Which to reduce into our former fauour,<br>

You are assembled: and my speech entreats,<br>

That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace<br>

Should not expell these inconueniences,<br>

And blesse vs with her former qualities<br>
</p>

<p id="id00732">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,<br>

Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections<br>

Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace<br>

With full accord to all our iust demands,<br>

Whose Tenures and particular effects<br>

You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands<br>
</p>

<p id="id00733">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burg. The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet<br>

There is no Answer made<br>

<p id="id00734">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eng. Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd,<br>

Lyes in his Answer<br>

<p id="id00735">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France. I haue but with a curselarie eye<br>

O're-glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace<br>

To re-suruey them; we will suddenly<br>

And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,<br>

Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Quee. Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:<br>

Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,<br>

When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on<br>
</p>

<p id="id00737">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England. Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs,<br>

Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,<br>

Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,<br>

And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart<br>
</p>

<p id="id00742">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake<br>

your England<br>
</p>

<p id="id00743">   King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly
with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse
it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
like me, Kate?
  Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me</p>

<p id="id00744">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an<br>

Angell<br>
</p>

<p id="id00745">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il<br>
</p>

<p id="id00746">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush<br>

to affirme it<br>
</p>

<p id="id00747">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de<br>

tromperies<br>
</p>

<p id="id00748">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of<br>

men are full of deceits?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:<br>

dat is de Princesse<br>
</p>

<p id="id00749">   King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:
yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly
to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:
how say you, Lady?
  Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well</p>

<p id="id00750">   King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one
I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by
vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?
that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and
vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the
Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
and fairely, I pray thee</p>

<p id="id00751">   Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
Fraunce?
  King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue
the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
is France, and you are mine</p>

<p id="id00752">   Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat</p>

<p id="id00753">   King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife
about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie
quand sur le possession de Fraunce, &amp; quand vous aues le
possession
de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee
my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, &amp; vous estes mienne.
It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me</p>

<p id="id00754" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il
&amp; melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle</p>

<p id="id00755">   King. No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st
thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
mee?
  Kath. I cannot tell</p>

<p id="id00756">   King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile
aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather
gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:
Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire
Flower-de-Luce</p>

<p id="id00757">   Kate. I doe not know dat</p>

<p id="id00758">   King. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your
French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,
take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer
you. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher &amp; deuin
deesse</p>

<p id="id00759" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Kath. Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to
deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce</p>

<p id="id00760">   King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare
not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter
me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne
out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder
I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,
will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of
England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England
is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his
Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer
in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,
breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
haue me?
  Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere</p>

<p id="id00761" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   King. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please
him, Kate</p>

<p id="id00762">   Kath. Den it sall also content me</p>

<p id="id00763">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady. Ouy verayment<br>
</p>

<p id="id00771">   King. O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.
Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers
of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes
our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I
will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,
Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a
generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your
Father.
Enter the French Power, and the English Lords.</p>

<p id="id00772">&nbsp;&nbsp;Burg. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,<br>

teach you our Princesse English?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;King. I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how<br>

perfectly I loue her, and that is good English<br>
</p>

<p id="id00773">   Burg. Is shee not apt?
  King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition
is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
likenesse</p>

<p id="id00774">   Burg. Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must
make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you
blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
(my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne
to</p>

<p id="id00775">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind<br>

and enforces<br>
</p>

<p id="id00776">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burg. They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see<br>

not what they doe<br>
</p>

<p id="id00777">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to<br>

consent winking<br>
</p>

<p id="id00778">   Burg. I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you
will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well
Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde,
blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then
they will endure handling, which before would not abide
looking on</p>

<p id="id00779">   King. This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot
Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in
the latter end, and she must be blinde to</p>

<p id="id00780">   Burg. As Loue is my Lord, before it loues</p>

<p id="id00781">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke<br>

Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire<br>

French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my<br>

way<br>
</p>

<p id="id00782">   French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely:
the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are
all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred</p>

<p id="id00783">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England. Shall Kate be my Wife?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;France. So please you<br>

<p id="id00784">   England. I am content, so the Maiden Cities you
talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in
the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my
Will</p>

<p id="id00785">   France. Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason</p>

<p id="id00786">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England. Is't so, my Lords of England?<br>

My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath<br>

<p id="id00799">Thus farre with rough, and all-vnable Pen,<br>

Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story,<br>

In little roome confining mightie men,<br>

Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.<br>

Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued<br>

This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword;<br>

By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:<br>

And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord.<br>

Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King<br>

Of France and England, did this King succeed:<br>

Whose State so many had the managing,<br>

That they lost France, and made his England bleed:<br>

Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,<br>

In your faire minds let this acceptance take.<br>
